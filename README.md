This is the git repo for the sources of my [bookmarklets page](https://thomasleplus.github.io/bookmarklets).

If you don't know what bookmarklets are, I recommend this [introduction](https://www.howtogeek.com/189358/beginner-geek-how-to-use-bookmarklets-on-any-device/).

If you are familiar with bookmarklets but you are not sure how to install one, you can find detailed instructions [here](https://mreidsma.github.io/bookmarklets/installing.html).
