This bookmarklet changes the sort order of your current Amazon.com search to order the results by descending number of user reviews. I find that using this sort in combination with the "Avg. Customer Review" filter greatly improves my searches.

> Note: for some reason this sort does not work until you limit your search to a "department" of the Amazon.com online store. 

Here is a link demonstrating the result for USB cables: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=usb+cable&i=electronics&s=review-count-rank
