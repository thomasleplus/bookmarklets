This bookmarklet spells the current selection using NATO alphabet. The case of the NATO name will be the same at the case of the original character. Characters that are not part of the NATO alphabet will be percent-encoding (e.g. %2F for '/') to help identify them. This bookmarklet can be used to identify characters that are ambiguous in certain typefaces. For example the number zero (0) will be spelled "zero" while the letter capital O will be spelled "Oscar".
